# treePiPy
## Small project to initiate me in git/python/
The idea is create a backend class to control the ligths of the tree with diferent settings. Ex spinning, blinking, etc, this class can be called from the flask web service frontend. Buttons with the different settings must be present. After this is done, create a wifi hotspot on the pi to connect directly and only allow this page to show
